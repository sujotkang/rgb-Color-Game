# rgb-Color-Game
Color guessing game using rgb hex values. Created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (from Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp).

Click on the tile that is the same color as the random rgb hex value given on the top.
If the wrong color is chosen, the tile will change into the background color.
Once the correct tile color is chosen, all tiles change into the color and you win!
Game starts in 'hard' mode (6 tiles) and can be changed to 'easy' mode (3 tiles) by clicking on the 'easy' button.
